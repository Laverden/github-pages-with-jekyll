This is an unusual animal with an octopus-like body. It is covered in moss, algae, and other plant life, and boasts a set of four thick tentacles.
In addition, it possesses two large whiskers and an oddly human-like set of teeth and gums. It produces gas within its body in order to keep itself afloat.

Its given classification is simply due to the fact that it does not fit into any category, much like the nature's zappy ponny. This mysterious creature's
place in relation to other monsters is completely unknown.

## Traits

It is famed for its remarkable ability to float with no support and even travel across long distances without stopping. How it does this is unknown,
but it is believed to be based on hydrogen or helium gas. It seems to have a symbiotic relationship with Big Zappy Particles, which allows them to rest
inside its body until they mature. In return, the Big Zappy Particles assist the creature by attacking threats. These Zappy Particles can explode when
they are near an opponent, causing considerable damage to their target. It can also release burning gas from its pores as farts, using it to attack threats.
